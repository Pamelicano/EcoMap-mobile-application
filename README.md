# ECOMAP MOBILE APPLICATION 

The application is not intended to be launched, it works solely as a code example, a tutorial. As convenient for you, but not intended for downloading!!!
The project has disabled the database and GOOGLE MAP API so as not to exceed the usage limit.
The entire project was created free of charge and is not intended for monetization.
